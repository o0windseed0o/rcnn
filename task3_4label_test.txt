0	i had rented a car from a local company , they needed the car back for 1 day to get it registered . they gave me a loaner car to use and the loaner car broke down while i was driving it . the car rental company is saying its my fault and that i have to pay for a new engine on the loaner car . i refused to pay and the car rental place said it will send it to the police and the courts . i am an american female . any advice ?	tell them to go ahead . unless you were negligent , it 's their problem . you did n't take a sledgehammer to it , did you ? you did n't put something other than motor oil in , did you ? seems to me you 'd really have to try hard to blow an engine in one day .

1	hey i would like to know where in qatar i get some good quality dog accesorries ? incl . dog collars , dog bed , bowls ?	i have found it rather hit or miss to find good quality dog toys/treats/medicines/dog beds . i have found that i can order many of these on line and have them shipped here ( hey , my dog is worth every riyal ) . http : //www.dog-beds-n-beyond.com/coolaroodogbed.html is a website with a description and picture if you 're interested . shop around , prices do vary . i have also bought frontline and preventic collars to help prevent tick infestations on line . hope this helps .
3	hey i would like to know where in qatar i get some good quality dog accesorries ? incl . dog collars , dog bed , bowls ?	as a continuation of my previous post , you can find somethings here , the prices can be more expensive ( or less so when you take into consideration shipping etc . ) however , the bed is something i 've never seen here . i like it because it keeps the dog off the floor , easy on the joints - my dog is older , and cooler as the air circulates around it . it is also easy to clean/wash and dries quickly .

0	can a foreigner ( muslim ) marry qatari woman ? any conditions apply ?	non-muslim men can not marry a muslim lady i believe you will have to convert and face a tremendous amount of difficulty , this is not a normal event in qatar . other questions can arise about children , that 's why u get married , in the past they could not automatically be qatari ! either way qatar is changing , the fact that you can meet a qatari lady and get to this stage in your relationship could not have happened in the past without male relatives deciding to avenge such an insult ! proceed carefully !

1	i am looking for an avery labels , i wonder if anyone know where could i buy them . many thanks ... crm	i bought some labels at the bookstore near the burger king r/a but not the avery 's one . it was my first time there and they have few selection of things , i was kind of in a rush when i went there but will try to come back again and see what exactly they have .
3	i am looking for an avery labels , i wonder if anyone know where could i buy them . many thanks ... crm	the selection is actually pretty good . i was looking at the labels that are 10 to a sheet - large enough for decent nametags . i ca n't remember what the per-sheet price was , but the entire box ( 1000 labels total ) was either 45qr or 55qr . assuming i have all the numbers right - and assuming that they work in a printer as well as the name-brand labels , that makes them significantly less expensive than even the office max brand labels in the u.s . i think i 'll give them a try !

0	well iv heard lots of things about the kn filter and thought i might get one installed in my 2009 vxr for about 500qr . just wanted to ask existing users , is it a good thing to buy ? i mean i know that it improves the hp , accelleration..blah blah.. but is it worth buying ? and is the improvement recognisable ?	first-it will not boost your horspower or acceleration anything considerable-if you where racing and a 1/100th of a second counted then ok. also , more importantly , as abuamerican said-it could void your warranty- check with toyota first .

0	ahoy there fellow primates v 3.0 any richard dawkins fan around ?	not really , he is not full of himself , imagine yourself in his shoes ? dozens and dozens of people try to debate logic and scientific facts based on thousands of years old scriptures . it must be tough . especially his hate e-mail . http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=-zuowncugsc & feature=related
1	ahoy there fellow primates v 3.0 any richard dawkins fan around ?	surprised to see this posted . i 've read his books for 20 years and the science is fascinating . nevertheless , i 'm not sure that atheism can be explicitly expressed openly here .
0	ahoy there fellow primates v 3.0 any richard dawkins fan around ?	yeah , but i guess here is acceptable at some extent . anyhow , his books are made simple for the simple common minds , a genius he is , i must confess ! do you have any of his books please ? ! cheers .
0	ahoy there fellow primates v 3.0 any richard dawkins fan around ?	why is not atheism acceptable here ? it 's a point of view , the same as believing in god or believing in fast cars or the bottom of a whisks bottle . if you are scared of atheism then your faith must be weak
0	ahoy there fellow primates v 3.0 any richard dawkins fan around ?	i have strong disagreements with what he says but i agree with his main point ... also i do n't particularly mind his aggressive approach
0	ahoy there fellow primates v 3.0 any richard dawkins fan around ?	yes , sure atheism is not acceptable here like satanism ...
2	ahoy there fellow primates v 3.0 any richard dawkins fan around ?	but is n't satan the ultimate rebel and the original freedom fighter braveheart
1	ahoy there fellow primates v 3.0 any richard dawkins fan around ?	dawkins believes satan does n't exist so that is good for all of us
2	ahoy there fellow primates v 3.0 any richard dawkins fan around ?	men believed the universe revolved around the earth until we knew better , same with the universe . just because we do n't know everything does n't mean you can make something up to fill the gaps ! that 's what children do !
2	ahoy there fellow primates v 3.0 any richard dawkins fan around ?	i am wise enough and comfortable enough to say i do n't know . i do n't need to fill the void with fantasies , such as sun gods , moon goods , animal gods , gods in the image of man etc .
1	ahoy there fellow primates v 3.0 any richard dawkins fan around ?	great , .. if you do n't know , this does n't men there 's no god . because if you are wise enough , you should believe there 's someone created all of this ... . next step , . you have to know , .. because this answer will not relief you in the judgement day ... this is an faithful advise ...
1	ahoy there fellow primates v 3.0 any richard dawkins fan around ?	i do n't know if you are a child abuser either but that does n't make you a child abuser does it . if your faith in one god , ignoring the other 6900 since the sumerians , makes you happy then good for you . i 'm not hear to change your faith or beliefs , you are free to believe in whatever you want no matter how ridiculous
3	ahoy there fellow primates v 3.0 any richard dawkins fan around ?	never heard of him ... ... .who is he ? and no i ca n't be bothered to google him ... ..
3	ahoy there fellow primates v 3.0 any richard dawkins fan around ?	he wrote the selfish gene one of the seminal books on evolution in the 1970s as well as many others . i recommend the blind watchmaker as a superbly written science book . recently he has drifted into the god arena and wrote the god deluision a few years ago . another interesting read
2	ahoy there fellow primates v 3.0 any richard dawkins fan around ?	it 's like an angel pissing on your tonsils
3	ahoy there fellow primates v 3.0 any richard dawkins fan around ?	believing in god and angels ? damn ! that is too mainstream ! i believe in the flying spaghetti monster , and jojo of the sea !
2	ahoy there fellow primates v 3.0 any richard dawkins fan around ?	so if god is not there , then satan is not there , ..so why people are making sins , ... ? ? answer that is you can , .. : p
0	ahoy there fellow primates v 3.0 any richard dawkins fan around ?	if heaven kitty and satanic kitten do not exist , then why cats keep publicly have intercourse ? answer ? because they can !
3	ahoy there fellow primates v 3.0 any richard dawkins fan around ?	what are sins ? what you consider a sin , is not what someone else would think it is a sin . sin is a human made concept for control
3	ahoy there fellow primates v 3.0 any richard dawkins fan around ?	qdc , in your company , going home before the end of shift is a sin . it 's a rule put by the owners , known by all staff , and violators are being punished ( and that 's why we adhere to rules ) . then you can have an organized company of say 100 people . so why you can not imagine the whole universe have an owner who put rules , and have a judgement day , .. ? ? ! ! simple is n't it
3	ahoy there fellow primates v 3.0 any richard dawkins fan around ?	one day i might if there is evidence . so far no evidence of a designer or ruler of the universe
2	ahoy there fellow primates v 3.0 any richard dawkins fan around ?	i am not picking anything up . did you or did you not say : `` but the last thing i want is to be e-bashed by non-factual thousands of years old poetry '' ? you did n't say it 's written in a poetic style , you said the words `` non-factual '' and `` poetry '' . yes i ( and many others ) get offended when you accuse the holy scriptures of being poetry .
2	ahoy there fellow primates v 3.0 any richard dawkins fan around ?	okay let me clear this up , since i am pretty sure you picked up your english through hollywood movies . fact : is something /event ... . that has happened/could be proven logically and physically . poetry : poetry is a style of written/spoken literature . please clear up why you got offended . as a muslim and mature individual , i do not get easily offended , just because i did not fully understand the other person does n't mean i have to be offended ...
2	ahoy there fellow primates v 3.0 any richard dawkins fan around ?	you are entitled to your own opinions but not your own facts . religion has no basis in facts
2	ahoy there fellow primates v 3.0 any richard dawkins fan around ?	you just summed up everything i wanted to say ! cheers mate .
2	ahoy there fellow primates v 3.0 any richard dawkins fan around ?	it 's fine if you want to disagree with me that is your right but you can say what i write is baseless , you have no evidence for that !
0	ahoy there fellow primates v 3.0 any richard dawkins fan around ?	and chris hitchens on religion . also very much admire aronra . favourite show is atheist experience - check it out http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=0k1eliyrc24 # movie_player
2	ahoy there fellow primates v 3.0 any richard dawkins fan around ?	well i guess the `` you are entitled to your own opinion '' is no longer valid when there is no logical come back .
