Why dont u ask your company to provide you transportation and ask for 4k more as accommodation and food allowance . Most importantly , 8k isnt a great salary but it all again depends on your job profile and work experience .

If the company is from Oil and Gas Industry or working for that Industry , then their accommodation and transport will be better . If it is normal construction company , they dont have good facilities . As far as your question of salary is concerned , you dont need to ask , as Dubai is not so different from Qatar and the currency is also the same .

The camp at NDIA is not too bad . Cabins are only a few years old and there are plenty facilities . Transport will be the yellow bus between camp and site - about 15 minutes driving max . Taxis tend not to call there so getting out on your own can be a hassle unless you get pally with a kabayan with a pickup truck at his disposal ! If the salary is same as you get in Dubai you should be able to save more here .

How much should I expect in Qatar now ? Do you think it is better if I work here in Germany for like 5 years before i relocate ? Starting salary for civil engineers in Germany is about 10000 QR , so not really much ! Best regards	I 'm not acquainted with German work environment , but the whole thing looks like a joke to me . You are a civil engineer who dedicated at least 5 post-graduate years ( not working in parallel ) with no point or project behind your Ph.D. thesis other than getting the certificate ! ! ! ! ! ! And still you think that European degrees are better than Egyptian for instance .

Could more members of this forum verify one of these statements ? by the way , does working in scientific research count as work experience ? I mean I spent 5 years in laboratory doing experiments for my research , can I say I have laboratory experience now ?

We 're a rescue shelter only . If you 're looking for someone responsible and knowledgeable to care for your pet whilst you are away you will need to spend more then that . 2 months boarding in any of the catteries here in Qatar would be a minimum of QR2,400 . And it would probably cost more to have someone come to your house twice a day to care for him .

TB , you always amaze me with your confident yet ignorant answers , especially when it comes to the immigration issues . Of course ladies are allowed to sponsor their husbands . At least there is no a legal limitation on it . Yes , it 's is much more difficult , than husband sponsoring his wife.. but it IS possible . It depends on few factors , and each application is considered by the authorities on case-to-case basis .

Depends on the nationality of the subject . There are some nationalities which are `` frowned upon '' by the Qatari government ( due to political reasons ) . Jordanians , Iraqis , Palestinians ( from abroad ) and indians too as they always try to regulate the ratios of nationalities in the country .

0	Hi everybody , Somebody hit my car , the back side bumper is damaged , So I told police and they asked to come later . Will insurance pay my loss ? I have a third party insurance . Thanks in advance !	If you dont know who hits you , then you are responsible to go to police dept . to make a report for the damage and you 'll pay 110 . They will check also if you have any violation ( if you have , sadly you have to pay it or else you 're not gon na get the report ) .

2	can you find cheerios in Doha ? ? ?	Do get doody . have honey cheerios home which occasion eat cause 're tasty . What meant say , did come , was advertising campaign that Nestle cheerios has is exaggerated . Companies nestle tend amplify what nutritional value products have convince consumers buy . Like expat sueno says , are bit healthier other stuff same time 're healthy . Anyway do mean be diet Nazi , eat what wish : ) Oh have agree Doratheexplorer , 'm sure giving cheerios baby have check .
0	can you find cheerios in Doha ? ? ?	I saw them on sunday in Megamart
0	can you find cheerios in Doha ? ? ?	There was also some at Shoprite . Motherhood ... The hardest job you 'll ever love ! : )
0	can you find cheerios in Doha ? ? ?	The Honey Nut Cheerios almost always seem to be in stock at MegaMart - at least when I go . The regular Cheerios are more difficult to find , but they do exist . ( Buy them up when you can find them ! ) Keep in mind that the Honey Nut Cheerios have a lot of sugar ( 9g per serving ) compared to the regular Cheerios ( 1g per serving ) http : //www.webmd.com/food-recipes/news/20081001/kids-cereals-some-are-50-percent-sugar They 're not as bad as some other cereals that target kids , but they 're still quite sweet .
3	can you find cheerios in Doha ? ? ?	thank you all for the inputs ... i hope i 'll get to find those regular cheerios
0	can you find cheerios in Doha ? ? ?	So funny that you asked because I 've been looking for them for a while too . Here 's my info : 1 . Regular , plain cheerios : I 've only found them at Megamart . And they cost like 23 riyals for a very small box ! 2 . Honey Cheerios ( from Nestle ) : These are available at just about every grocery store like Family Food Centre , Food Palace , Lulu , Carrefour . They only cost around 13 riyals for a box . Hope this helps .
0	can you find cheerios in Doha ? ? ?	I was going to write the same thing as NY couple . In Family food centre you can occassionally get vanilla cheerios which do well on the taste buds but are a bit on the expensive side - like 35 riyals .
3	can you find cheerios in Doha ? ? ?	Oh and do n't buy into that wholegrain healthy crap that all these cereals advertised . They 're all still pretty heavily processed . Best healthiest thing to do for breakfast is eat as much protein as you can - hence eggs are highly recommended .
3	can you find cheerios in Doha ? ? ?	you 're right to an extent , villagejoker
0	can you find cheerios in Doha ? ? ?	Cheerios is a cereal name brand . I 'd check Mega Mart . There are many western products in stock there . Prepare to pay out the wazoo for them though !

If you ca n't get a new job you might have to borrow money from family back home to pay back the loans here , otherwise things can get difficult .

Please help me to give right answers.. Thanks and Best regards	Nothing fatal ! Find another job and keep paying your loan , what 's the problem ? Loan and credit cards have nothing to do with your sponsorship . Unless your company cancelled your RP ... then your current company must inform your bank , and they will simply freeze your account until you find another job . Nothing extraordinary . If you want to leave for good , you will have to pay off your loan . Then sell your car and close the outstanding balance , that 's it .

Am I gon na get fine QR6000 for this ? ? ? Please your kind advise if you ever had this experience . Thank you so much . Nervous Mom	Traffic rules 101 - Red means to STOP ... So , If you 've crossed the lights while anything but red , you are good . Some people are extra cautious and stop when the green starts to blink ( that is just a personal choice ) because the fines are just too hefty . But they risk getting rammed from the behind if they brake suddenly . You can pass through even on amber , but it is just not worth taking that risk . Best is to always reduce speed while approaching the lights .

3	hey guys , anybody who knows the requirements for the affidavit of support in philippine embassy ?	actually sir i am asking for a family visit visa for my cousin . they said that there is no available family visa right now thats why they just give me a business visa for her.so do you think they will authenticate the letter from my company and the immigration oficer will accept this one ? thans sir alexam .
0	hey guys , anybody who knows the requirements for the affidavit of support in philippine embassy ?	@ lizkat . Family visit visa is only applicable to immediate family members such as husband , children , parents and siblings . Your cousin is not your immediate relative . So you can not apply for a family visit visa for her/him .
3	hey guys , anybody who knows the requirements for the affidavit of support in philippine embassy ?	so it means that even if my sister will have the same business visa they will still refuse to give me an affidavit of support . thats so sad . i just wanted them to be with me for a week or two so we could be together .
0	hey guys , anybody who knows the requirements for the affidavit of support in philippine embassy ?	What you need is your passport copy and residence visa copy . The passport copy of the person you 're sponsoring . To be 100 % sure call the embassy 44831-585 and 44836-871 .
3	hey guys , anybody who knows the requirements for the affidavit of support in philippine embassy ?	i already called there sir . unfortunately they did n't gave me the requirements because they said that it is only for family visit visa.i need it for business visa of my cousin.do you think they will entertain me ? thanks so much .
0	hey guys , anybody who knows the requirements for the affidavit of support in philippine embassy ?	I see . You 're in a different situation . You do n't need an affidavit of support since your cousin will be on a business visa . What you need is an assurance letter from the company or person that granted the visa regarding the stay of your cousin here in Doha .
0	hey guys , anybody who knows the requirements for the affidavit of support in philippine embassy ?	PE will not issue u Affidavit of Support . They will only issue the said document to those who were given visit visa under your sponsorship . They will also ask for a copy of MoI visa printout .

We tried to contact the custom authorities , our shipping agents , and ask how to go about to claim it back . So far , we have n't had any luck . Does anyone has this experience before ?

Alcohol is restricted because Qatar is officially a Muslim country . 2 . Muslims are prohibited ( by law anyway ) from having a liquor or pork license and are not supposed to be served at hotel bars . We all know , of course , that many people find their way around it . MODS -- please take a note of this purposeful oversensitivity and baiting . To the OP -- it 's easily obtainable , but expensive .

0	Can an Emirate National get an alcohol permit ?	Call QDC tel : 44699413
0	Can an Emirate National get an alcohol permit ?	Yes , you can get the liquor license if you hold a valid RP in QATAR . You just need a letter from your sponsor stating your designation with your salary ( All Allowances Must Be Included ) , Copy of RP from your passport , QR.1000/- ( One time deposit ) .. Go to QDC , fill up the form , submit all the above . If approved , you will be granted the permit in 15min .
0	Can an Emirate National get an alcohol permit ?	I dont think so brother
0	Can an Emirate National get an alcohol permit ?	Of course assuming you are a muslim , I think you have no chance of getting a liquor license . Not sure about Qatar , but I know of a friend of mine that has an Australian passport , but he is a muslim , and they refused a license to him in the UAE . I would think unless you can provide proof to the authorities that you are not muslim , then you will have no success . Of course , I could be wrong , but I doubt it in this case .
0	Can an Emirate National get an alcohol permit ?	are u out of ur mind ? ? dont u have a littel dignity or shame ? ? is this the image u want to give about muslims ? if u a muslim dont follow ur religion and stick to it how do u expext others to respect u and respect ur religion and convince them about it ? ? ? ? sooooo shocked and ur from emirates ? ? ? ? waw what do ur parents think ? ? ?

1	Hi Guys , Cam someone confirm this information that MEN are not allowed to get Automatic licence directly and do not have to do a manual test . Your answers will be apprecitated . Thanks Leon	I did the sriving test on manual gear too . But the advantage was that my licence allowed me to drive either an automatic or a manual car .

1	Does anyone know where to purchase a TENS machine or have one for sale ? TIA	TENS means Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator . It is commonly used in Physical Therapy depts as a modality to treat denervated muscles like those in stroke or spinal injury patients . These are the ones you see with pads connected to the muscles to make it twitch or on higher frequency , to relieve pain . However , this machine should only be operated by a licenced physiotherapist with the supervision of a doctor . Untrained use of TENS might result to electrocution accidents .

0	I was very interested when I first QL , I thought it is nice site . But sorry to say the site is more rejecting than welcoming to new ppl . or even to old members but not as popular as other QL big names . Posts are getting so silly , no attractive posts , ppl are divided into groups . Please leaders of QL , try to drag QL from being another useless site . Thanks ,	how are things ? ? Grant me the senility to forget the people I never liked , the good fortune to run into the ones I do , and the eyesight to tell the difference .
0	I am a civil engineer here in the philippines and soon be working in qatar ? what visa should they be have ? and how long is the processing ? what are the requirements ? thank you .	Your contract should tell that your status should be family , and not bachelor , so that your family will be taken here to Qatar , with all expenses paid by the company . Several companies are doing like that here in Qatar . Of course , it will be better for your to be family status , since the beginning that you are working here at Qatar . Because , not only for monetray reasons , but if your company will shoulder the expenses , they will help you in acquiring the family visa .

Once back they can be presented to CEID .

I 'm planning to retake the test sometime this month . By doing so , do you go over the test from the start ? Or do you start where you left off ( failed ) ? Like me , for example , I failed the road test , so does that mean I only do the road test ? Thanks !	You need to appear only from the test you failed and do not have to repeat the passed ones . Try to get a new date ; it may take quite a while i.e . around a month . Good Luck

Do people usually drink from tap or bottled water in Qatar ? Since tap water got me sick once in my city ! !	Bottled water is pretty cheap and lots of places sell large jugs for water coolers . There is very little to do here and there is a caste system between the different races , so luxary items aimed at the favored nationals and food targeted at westerners as well as western housing is expensive . Though most items have cheap alternatives .

3	Recently I heard that QCB has instructed to reduce the loan interest to 6 % for the new and existing loan holders . Any update on this I am HSBC customer and still they deduct same amount ...

Thanks ... Hope as per QBC directive they will reduce the interest . Will wait for the next month and see .

The reason I mentioned the 5 % was because there were signs posted all around town ( last I saw one was about a month ago ) advertising 5 % interest on savings accounts . I believe it was QNB , but I 'm not sure . Yes , I 've heard similar bad things about HSBC . Looks like I 'll be looking into QNB and Commercial Bank then . One of my most important requirements is seamless online access and transfers .

I would like to know so I know what size sheets to purchase .	if your company will provide you housing , usually , if the housing is not yet ready for occupancy , they will get a hotel accomodation for you and your family . if it 's ready , then you 'll be going to your house straight from the airport . like me , the housing was ready so the company driver delivered me staright there , unlike my colleague he was stayed at the hotel until the housing 's ready .

0	will be traveling with one child . I have read that 2 bedrooms comes with one king bed and a medium bed in the other room ? Is the medium bed a queen bed or full size bed ? I would like to know so I know what size sheets to purchase .	If your housing is not ready , you may be taken to a hotel or a serviced apartment , or guest house/ accommodations . These will be fully furnished . If its a two bedroom apartment , it 's not necessary that the second room will have a medium size bed , it may have 2 single beds , and that can be 90x180 or 120x180 cm . Do n't get the sheets for the guest bedroom yet . You may get one king size bed sheet for the master bedroom .

( small number of companies do this , discreetly . ) as you well know ... no NOC means 2 years ban.. : (

Has anyone got their visa like this ? How long it takes ? Any travel agents assists in this process or i 've send through DHL .	If you take a schengen visa from any other country , you are obligated to enter the schengen area through that country or should spend atleast one day more in that country . You could take a schengen visa through the italian embassy right here in Doha and fly to Milan . You can then take a 3 hour train to Geneva .

Been to Far East few times it was safe with me . But two of my friends recently lost their passports . One in Bangkok from their Hotel room and one in Malaysia from their backpack . I Just wanted to know what do you all normally do ?	do not carry it around with you and do not leave it in a suitcase in your room . Put it in the hotel room safe . If there is none , put in a safety deposit box that the hotel provides . Make sure YOU put it inside , and you get a form from the hotel that indicates that it is their locker and that your passport is in there . With that , THEY have to take responsibility if something untoward happens and ca n't blame you .

I Just wanted to know what do you all normally do ?	Its always the best practice to hand it over at the Hotel Reception while you check-in & get it back on Check-out ! Carrying passport along is even more risky that leaving it in a safe locker in your room ! I got my Laptop bag stolen in Barcelona this time & had much of my important docs in it , luckily my passports were in the Hotel Reception.. ! Ofcourse , once you loose passport , its a nightmare !

Yes BM.. losing your passport is a nightmare..my friend had to go back to India and wait for three weeks to get his new Passport and visa done to come back here . Thats why I am worried . As Khanan said..I was also thinking of depositing it at the Hotel reception . Even if they pickpocket our money , cards ... we can somehow get back here ... but without passport we will be stranded there .

0	I really want to stop smoking . I have tried almost everything except hypnotherapy . Does anyone know any good hypnotherapist here in Qatar ? Thank you all .	Best way to get rid of smoking habbit is gradually decrease the number . think of times when you just smoke for the heck of it , such as with cup of tea , as soon as you sit in the car etc and then avoid lighting up one at such times . chew a gum or carry a can of juice with you while in the car or outdoor . Dont deprive yourself by just deciding to quit , it will not work . all the best
0	Hi , I am moving over in January from Oz and I am thinking about shipping a box over to Doha , from what I can find on the net it seems to be fairly pricey , just wondering if anyone has any tips on who I should use ? Or if it is just easier to use excess baggage ? thanks .	It can actually be cheaper to go excess baggage - if you 're travelling via Emirates you will be allowed 2 x 30Kg bags anyways - Qatar Air has a very miserly baggage allowance .

0	i am an indian having Qatar Residence permit ( currently in India ) with A profession of `` Administrative '' . let me know is this profession eligible to get Dubai On Arrival Visa ? ? expecting reply ... .	The profession you mentioned is not listed so it will be better to check with the Airlines first . They will not let you board if the profession is not eligible to get the visa on arrival . There is no credit card payment at Dubai Airport . You should buy one e-card from the bank counter for the visa charges and that is the only one the Immigration will accept and the bank will accept any valid currencies according their exchange rates .

DXB Immigration only accept cash payments at the two exchange counters at the back of the hall . I was there earlier this week and had to join the queue to pay for my eGate card : o ( It would probably be wiser to send your mandoob with your passport to the UAE embassy and get the visa before you travel .

0	Hi , my husband has been offered a job in Qatar with a salary of 16000. we have a 3 year old child . I would like to know whether 16000 is good enough a package considering its all inclusive which means we will have to rent a 2 bedroom apartment , get a car , etc . We would like to put our child in a good Indian curriculum school . Please help me out .	First- Not very advisable to put up the name of the company with your real name . Edit that part out . Second- As for the salary , it 's good enough , not great but not bad either.. Families are living on 8,000 QAR as well and I meet some families moaning about only 50,000 that they get . If he is in sales , he should get a car from the company so I guess you can cross out that from your expenditure . Every sales guy in here gets one .

A good 2BHK would cost you somewhere around QR 6000-8000 ( furnished/semi furnished ) ..And that too depends on the locality ... There are few good INDIAN SCHOOLS in DOHA..seeing your baby 's age , better drop her at KINDERGARTEN first which are of in abundance in DOHA ...
